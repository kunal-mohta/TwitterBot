# TwitterBot

A simple Twitter Bot, that tweets every day at the same time. It is made using the [twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) npm package. Further, [Cron Job](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/scheduling-tasks-with-cron-jobs--net-8800) is used on the server to schedule the tweets. \
You can see the Bot functional at this [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/botprac).
